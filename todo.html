		<h2>Trekking and Climbing:</h2>
		<p>
			Nepal is a land of Trekking and Climbing. Trekking has always been one of the leading activities of tourists in Nepal. It offers some of the best trekking routes in the world. The 4 days Poonhill trek is one of the better short treks in Nepal; the Everest Base Camp trek is a great trek if having 12 days available. Some hike for few days only while others take a month long trek through valleys and high mountain passes. Two of the most popular trekking regions are the Everest and Annapurna where many different trails can be followed while the other popular treks are in the Langtang and Kanchenjunga regions. Similarly, if you're into climbing but lack experience we recommend Island Peak or Mera Peak. Both peaks reach +6,000 meters and can be summited by people with no prior mountaineering experience. It will definitely be a lifetime experience for the new climbers. <br><a href="index.html"> Read more</a>
